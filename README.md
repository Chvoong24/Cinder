## How To Fetch Data
1. Go to the **fetch_all.py** file
2. Run file
3. Wait for completion checks in IDE terminal (may take a while)
4. Files appear in ```<model>_download```. Logs appear in ```<model>_log``` folder


## How To Interrupt Data Fetch
1. For VSCode: Press ```Ctrl``` + ``` C ``` until terminal stops printing

## How Do You Know It Works? (Unit Tests)
1. Run ```fetch_all.py```
0. Go into repository directory
0. *If* ```<model>_data``` exists and contains ```<model>_download``` and ```<model>_logs```, it passes unit test
0. *If not*, it has failed

## Documentation
Documentation for all functions can be found at ```build/html/index.html```. It is still work in progress.
